# reolink_relay
This is a light micropython application that utilises a ESP8266 microcontroller
as an API client for a Reolink NVR with the intention of providing a method of 
remotely triggering an external device such as an audio alarm or strobe light.

## Installation
This build was done using a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller running Micropython 
version 1.19.

mbremote was used to load files and libraries to the microcontroler once the firmware 
was loaded.
